The VidTube app is a video sharing app, made for allowing users across the world to upload and share their video content, comment their thoughts and interact with each other.
This Readme file contains an overview of the Android app and its features, along with a guide on how to run it on your machine.

## How To Run
In order to run the Android app, start by cloning the repository to Android Studio, you can do this by opening the terminal and entering this command:
`git clone https://github.com/eyalg43/project_android.git`.

After cloning the repository, open the project in Android Studio.
(Note: if you are using a physical device, make sure to change the code, such that in every place that it says "10.0.2.2", change it to your IP address)

Now clone the server using your IDE of choice, you can do this by opening the terminal and entering this command: `git clone https://github.com/OCDev1/VidTube-server.git` Or download the repository to your computer.

If you downloaded the repo-change the directory in your terminal to the downloaded repo directory. (if you cloned to your IDE then ignore this)

While in the project directory run:
### `npm install`

and wait for it to finish installing.

### Setting up config and .env.local
In the project directory go to the "config" folder (its in the main project directory) and inside it you will find a file called ".env.local", inside
".env.local" change the conncetion string to the connection string of your MongoDB, and set PORT to 12345.
it should look something like this:

`CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/vidtube` (change to the connection string of your MongoDB)
<br>`PORT=12345` (NOTE: you must use 12345 for it to work)
<br>there is also `JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key` (you can ignore this)

* Open MongoDB on your computer.

### insertData.js script

* Included in the project is a script called "insertData.js" which will initialize the database with users, videos and comments. we highly reccomend you run this script in order to get the best experience and see all the features (and also to save you some time (: )

* You can run the script by typing `node insertData.js` wait for the script to finish and your database should be initialized with videos, users and comments, hooray!

* NOTE: in order for the DB to be initialized with the users, videos and comments of the script, make sure you dont already have a database called "vidtube" (or else the script won't add it's data), if you do then delete the database and run the script again.

Now you can run

### `npm start`

Because this is for the 4th part, you should also ensure that the CPP server of the 4th part runs.

Now go back to Android studio and run the app, now you should be able to use the app!
Now you are all set up, enjoy!

## Our work process:
As usual, we started off by watching Hemi's videos, we set up the android to be in an MVVM architecture. Each group member had his responsibility, Eyal was responsible for the comments, Omri was responsible for the users and Max was responsible for the videos. We modified our code to work with the server we made in part 2, so the videos, comments and users are being kept in the database. We also added features that take advantage of the server like: users can edit and delete their own videos and comments, likes and dislikes are being saved and more.

### NEW!
* You can now delete your account or edit your user details in your profile page, you can reach it by clicking on the "You" option in the side menu.

* In the watch video screen, clicking the uploaders image or name will take you to his profile page where you can see more videos that he uploaded.

* Clicking your profile picture in the side menu will take you your videos page, in which you can edit and delete your videos.

* Users can now edit and delete only their own comments and videos.
